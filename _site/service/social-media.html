<p>Social media (Social Media Marketing) nowadays are no longer used only to chat with friends or to meet new people, but are increasingly used to build a companyâ€™s image among potential customers.</p>

<p>By creating a community around a certain area, we make it possible to share the thoughts, opinions or needs of those who speak in a public forum. This gives the company the opportunity to listen to their current or potential customers and draw conclusions that can help improve their products or services, but also create a bond and image of the company with the customer, so we are seen as specialists and people willing to help in the field.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that the key in social media is dialogue and it plays the most important role in this area of marketing. In order to effectively use Social Media Marketing you need to have a strategy and define the goals you are aiming for. Then choose the right tools and of course the most important thing is to conduct an appropriate dialogue and measure its effectiveness.</p>
